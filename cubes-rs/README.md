Cubes
======

Applications for determining how to put a cube together and for creating
visualizations of the solution. There is a solver, a drawing program,
and an input program. The solver reads the puzzles in bincode format
which the input program saves the pieces as. The solve program writes
the pieces and one of the solutions as OBJ files.
