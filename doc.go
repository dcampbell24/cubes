Put the pieces of a cube together!

At some point this program should take as input a file describing the pieces of
a cube and then return plain text and video solutions showing how to put the
cube together, along with statistics such as how many solutions there are and how
hard they were to find, but, at the moment, it just creates OBJ files of the
pieces and plain text/OBJ solutions for a test cube.
